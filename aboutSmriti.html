                    <p>Hi, <br>
                        I am Smriti Mool from Nepal, currently staying at 325 Spruce Street, Waterloo, Canada. I've
                        completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering and have 4.5 years of professional
                        experience as a full-stack developer. <br> <br>

                        As a developer, programmer, or software engineer, I enjoy using various programming languages to
                        create computer software. I have a learning and never-giving-up attitude and prefer being
                        updated with recent technologies. I like being in in-charge of understanding the requirements
                        and building the appropriate solutions. Regarding my prior work experience, I was involved in
                        solving complicated business problems using both back-end technologies such as JAVA and
                        databases and front-end technologies such as Angular and ReactJS. With such hands-on experience,
                        I have become a critical thinker, a strong problem-solver, and the ability to use more than one
                        programming language along with designing, testing, and developing the software considering the
                        client's requirements. <br> <br>
                        Besides, I also have good written and communication skills and
                        strategies, which makes me convenient to communicate with supervisors and clients. It feels
                        great to say that the web browser, web pages, and so many innovative products to market would
                        have been impossible without the dedication of developers, and I enjoy every bit and piece of
                        being a part of this participation. I can go out of the box to suggest solutions and
                        functionalities that would otherwise be very time-consuming, missing requirements such as
                        exception handling and user experience, prioritizing customer security and safety, and recommend
                        creative opportunities to take advantage of all modern technologies. In addition, I have worked
                        as a Certified Scrum Master and as a developer. This dual responsibility has prepared me to work
                        under pressure, prioritize tasks, remove any impediments throughout the process, and ensure the
                        product backlog is in the right direction. I utterly value the concept of teamwork and coaching
                        the team members in self-management and cross-functionalities. As a developer representing the
                        delivery team, I have the traits of becoming a leader of my own or the team.
